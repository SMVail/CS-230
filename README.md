Module 8 - The Gaming Room Comleted

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their Android game “Draw It or Lose It” into a web-based, cross-platform application for use on Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices. The system needed to support multiple teams and players, ensure unique identifiers, allow only one active game instance in memory, and provide secure, scalable, real-time performance.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
- I clearly compared multiple operating systems and justified Linux as the best choice for hosting based on cost, scalability, and security. I also explained the object-oriented structure effectively, showing strong understanding of inheritance and class relationships.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
- Writing the design document helped me plan before coding, especially in defining architecture, constraints, and class relationships. It gave me a clearer roadmap for development and made the coding process more efficient and organized.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I would revise the System Architecture section to include a visual diagram showing how the client, server, and database interact. Adding a data flow diagram or API outline would make the document clearer and more complete.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I focused on accessibility, performance, and security to meet user needs. Making the game web-based ensures easy access from any device. Considering user needs is essential because software must be functional, enjoyable, and easy to use to succeed.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
- I used an object-oriented and client-server approach to design the system. In the future, I would use iterative design and user feedback earlier in the process, along with visual modeling tools, to improve clarity and collaboration.
